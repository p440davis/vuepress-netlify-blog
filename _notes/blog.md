# Blog

## Hi, I'm Pete Davis
 - I've started this blog to share my learning about VuePress. I'm currently building some websites in my spare time and as a fan of Vue, I've found VuePress to be the perfect way to create JAMstack sites with great User Experience (UX) and Developer experience (DX). You will find how-to guides and code examples from my own projects that you can use in your projects.
