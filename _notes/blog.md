## Gatsby, Gridsome or VuePress?
 - Gatsby and Gridsome if you want content from an API
	 - Benefits - choose headless CMS (but that can mean lock-in!)
	 - Content in multiple file formats (but that's untidy)
	 - GraphQl out of the box (but you probably don't need it)
 - VuePress if you want to keep content in Markdown
	 - Keep your content with your code (No lock-in)
	 - Choose a git-based CMS
 - Not as restrictive as it appears
	 - You can write HTML inside your markdown!
	 - You can use Vue components inside your markdown!!
	 - You can fetch dynamic data inside your markdown!!!
