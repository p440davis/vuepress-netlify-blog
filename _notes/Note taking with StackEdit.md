# Note taking with StackEdit
1. Markdown is a great format for taking notes. Easily convert them into blog posts 
2. GitHub is a great place to keep your notes - you can even keep them in a specific branch
3. StackEdit Workspaces give you a direct portal into wherever your notes are stored, so you can save notes within whichever GitHub repo the notes are related to. And they will be shared with the other contributors to that repo.
4. StackEdit can be installed as an app (PWA) on your phone/tablet, saves locally and works offline, so your notes are always with you.
5. You can use a static site generator like GitHub pages or VuePress to publish your notes on a website.
