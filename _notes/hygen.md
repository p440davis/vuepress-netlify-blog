# Generating frontmatter with Hygen
Save time adding frontmatter to your markdown files

This blog is made with VuePress, which like other Static Site Generators (SSG), builds your webpages from markdown (.md) files. 

You can start each .md file with frontmatter, a simple bit of code that defines things like:

 - title
 - language
 - description
 - permalink
 - meta

Manually adding frontmatter every time is tesiuo
