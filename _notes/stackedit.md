# Note taking with StackEdit
I recently heard Wes Boss keeps his notes in markdown (.md) files and decided to see if I could find an efficient way to do that myself.

## Why markdown?
Markdown is a great format for taking notes. You can just jot down few words, but if a not needs more structure, markdown has a simple formatting syntax that doesn't impair readability. 

Markdown has long been the standard format for software documentation. Now, with the popularity JamStack, it is rapidly becoming the format of choice for writing all web content. In my case I wanted to easily convert notes into posts on my VuePress powered blog.

## Storing notes on GitHub
It makes sense to store your markdown notes on GitHub, GitLab:

 - All the history and version control benefits of Git for your notes.
 - GitHub shows .md files as fully-formatted web content.
 - You can keep notes in separate repos, alongside the projects they relate to.
 - Your notes can be shared depending on who has access to your repo.

Initially I tried taking notes directly on GitHub, but it was way too laborious. You have to navigate to the correct repo, branch and folder, create a file (not forgetting the .md extension), switch back-and-forth between edit and preview to see your formatting and write a commit message every time you want to save!

All of this is even more cumbersome if you want to note down an idea on your phone when you're out and about.

Effective note taking solutions minimise the barriers between thinking of something and recording it.

## StackEdit to the rescue!

1. Markdown is a great format for taking notes. Easily convert them into blog posts and use a static site generator to get them online.
2. GitHub is a great place to keep your notes. You get the version history benefits of Git. You can keep notes in repos alongside the work the relate to, shared with the other contributors to that repo.
3. StackEdit Workspaces give you a direct portal into wherever your notes are stored, so you can save notes within whichever GitHub repo the notes are related to - you can even keep them in a specific branch. 
4. StackEdit can be installed as an app (PWA) on your phone/tablet, saves locally and works offline, so your notes are always with you.
5. StackEdit makes formatting you notes easy. If you're not already familiar with markdown, or even of you are, there's a toolbar to help you quickly format your content.
