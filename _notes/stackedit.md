# Note taking with StackEdit
I recently heard Wes Boss keeps his notes in markdown (.md) files and decided to see if I could find an efficient way to do that myself.

I wanted to store my notes in GitHub and keep notes in different repos alongside projects they related to, but I soon ran into a problem.a

Navigating around to the different places I kept notes, into the correct branch, finding the note getting into edit mode, manually making commits. 

## Benefits

1. Markdown is a great format for taking notes. Easily convert them into blog posts and use a static site generator to get them online.
2. GitHub is a great place to keep your notes. You get the version history benefits of Git. You can keep notes in repos alongside the work the relate to, shared with the other contributors to that repo.
3. StackEdit Workspaces give you a direct portal into wherever your notes are stored, so you can save notes within whichever GitHub repo the notes are related to - you can even keep them in a specific branch. 
4. StackEdit can be installed as an app (PWA) on your phone/tablet, saves locally and works offline, so your notes are always with you.
5. StackEdit makes formatting you notes easy. If you're not already familiar with markdown, or even of you are, there's a toolbar to help you quickly format your content.
