# Note taking with StackEdit
I recently heard Wes Boss keeps his notes in markdown (.md) files and decided to see if I could find an efficient way to do that myself.

## Why markdown?
Markdown is a great format for taking notes. You can just jot down few words, but if a note needs more structure, markdown has a simple formatting syntax that doesn't impair readability.

Markdown has long been the standard format for software documentation. Now, with the popularity JamStack, it is rapidly becoming the format of choice for writing all web content. In my case I wanted to easily convert notes into posts on my VuePress powered blog.

## Storing notes on GitHub
Storing your markdown notes in GitHub (or GitLab) has the following benefits:

 - All the benefits of Git.
 - GitHub shows .md files as fully-formatted web content.
 - You can keep notes in separate repos, alongside the projects they relate to.
 - Your notes can be shared depending on who has access to your repo.

Initially I tried taking notes directly on GitHub, but it was way too laborious. You have to navigate to the correct repo, branch and folder, create a file (not forgetting the .md extension), switch back-and-forth between edit and preview to see your formatting and write a commit message every time you want to save!

All of this is even more cumbersome if you want to note down an idea on your phone when you're out and about.

Effective note taking solutions minimise the effort between thinking of something and recording it.

## StackEdit to the rescue!

Here's what we need to make markdown notes stored in GitHub a viable note taking solution:

1. Quickly access, create and save notes in one place, regardless of what repo/folder they are stored in.
2. Works on all your devices, even when you're offline.
3. Nice markdown editing experience, with formatting visible while you edit.

This is exactly what StackEdit gives you.

## StackEdit Workspaces
Workspaces are direct portals into wherever your notes are stored. You can connect each workspace to a specific folder on a specific branch of a specific GitHub repo.

Once your workspace is connected StackEdit enables you to view, add, rename, edit and delete markdown files in that location. It then syncronises the changes you make with your GitHub repo, commuting changes for you automatically.
 
## StackEdit app
StackEdit is a Progressive Web App. That means it's a website that you can install and run like other apps on your phone, tablet, laptop etc.

Separating it from the browser makes it feel more like a focussed note taking app. It also means you can use it offline, saving notes on your device until you can reconnect and sync.

## StackEdit markdown editor
StackEdit makes formatting you notes easy. If you're not already familiar with markdown, or even of you are, there's a toolbar to help you quickly format your content. If you pas
