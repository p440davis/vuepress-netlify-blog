# Note taking with StackEdit
I recently heard Wes Boss keeps his notes in markdown (.md) files and decided to see if I could find an efficient way to do that myself.

Markdown is a great format for taking notes. You get all the formatting you might need to give your notes structure. Markdown is fast becoming the content editing format of choice for the web. For example, if you ever want to convert notes into a blog posts.

I wanted to store my notes in GitHub and keep notes in different repos alongside projects they related to, but I soon ran into a problem.

A good note taking workflow should minimise the time between having an idea and recording it. You don't want to navigate to the correct repo, branch, folder, file, switch to edit mode, and write a commit message every time you have an idea!

## Benefits

1. Markdown is a great format for taking notes. Easily convert them into blog posts and use a static site generator to get them online.
2. GitHub is a great place to keep your notes. You get the version history benefits of Git. You can keep notes in repos alongside the work the relate to, shared with the other contributors to that repo.
3. StackEdit Workspaces give you a direct portal into wherever your notes are stored, so you can save notes within whichever GitHub repo the notes are related to - you can even keep them in a specific branch. 
4. StackEdit can be installed as an app (PWA) on your phone/tablet, saves locally and works offline, so your notes are always with you.
5. StackEdit makes formatting you notes easy. If you're not already familiar with markdown, or even of you are, there's a toolbar to help you quickly format your content.
