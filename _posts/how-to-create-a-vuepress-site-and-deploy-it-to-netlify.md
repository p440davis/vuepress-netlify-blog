[VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) make it easy to generate and deploy static sites. Here's how you get your first VuePress site installed and online in just a few minutes.

## Before you start

You will need the usual front-end dev tools installed on your computer - [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [your favourite code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

Grab a fresh [GitHub](https://github.com/) repo for your site and [clone it](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) on your computer.

## VuePress in 5 steps

1. Add this to your `.gitignore` file

```
/node_modules
**/dist
```

2. Create a `.vuepress` folder with a `config.js` file and add

```js
module.exports = {
  title: "My First Vuepress Site",
  description: "Welcome to my first VuePress site"
};
```

3. Create `index.md` and add something like

```md
# Homepage

Welcome to my VuePress site
```

4. In the terminal run `npm init -y` and then `npm i vuepress -D`
5. Add `build` and `dev` scripts to your `package.json` file

<<< @/.vuepress/public/snippets/.package.json{7-8}

You should now have all of these files:

You are all set for a first look at your VuePress site locally. `npm run dev` launches a live server so that you can see changes in your browser as you develop your site.

All good? Commit and push your changes to GitHub.

## Deploy your site on Netlify

Login to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and follow the steps to create a new site from your GitHub repo.

Change the build command to `npm run build` and publish directory to `.vuepress/dist`.

Hit "Deploy site"!

After a short wait while Netlify runs your build, your site will deploy your site to a randomly generated url. You can change the name of your site or add your own domain name via 'Domain settings'.

VoilÃ ! Not only is your website deployed, it will magically redeploy with every change to master on GitHub.

## Adding pages and navigation

To demonstrate the Netlify CI process and make the site feel a bit more real, let's add another page and a menu.

Create a folder called `_pages` and add `about.md` with some markdown content like so:

```
---
title: About me
permalink: '/:slug'
---

# My life story
I was born on a rainy Tuesday in...
```

The bit between `---`'s is known as [front matter](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/frontmatter.html) and its purpose is to add data that is used when VuePress generates your site. In this case, the `title` is what gets displayed in the browser tab and setting `permalink: /:slug` means that _pages will be removed from the path in the page url.

Now that you have a new page, you need a way to navigate to it.

Edit your `.vuepress/config.js` file like so:

```js{4-9}
module.exports = {
  title: "My First Vuepress Site",
  description: "Welcome to my first VuePress site",
  themeConfig: {
    nav: [
      { text: "Home", link: "/" },
      { text: "About", link: "/about/" }
    ]
  }
};
```

Netlify will immediately notice when these changes reach your master branch on GitHub. As soon as it's done building, your site will be updated.
