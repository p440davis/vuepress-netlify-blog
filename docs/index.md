## Why VuePress?
VuePress is a site generator that combines speed, security and reliability of a static site with the slick user experiance of a single page app (SPA).

There is no database or server-side code code to worry about, making development.

VuePress is based on the much-loved Vue framework, which makes it easy to customise the theme and features of your site.

## Why Netlify CMS?
Netlify CMS adds content management interface to your site, making it easy to write, edit and publish your content without having to write any code.

## Prerequisites
Even if you are a beginner, you should be able to follow along with these tutorials successfully.

However, you will be able to do much more with your blog if you have some knowledge of html, css, js, Vue.js and git.
