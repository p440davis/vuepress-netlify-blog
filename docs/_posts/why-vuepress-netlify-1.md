## Why VuePress?

VuePress is a site generator that combines speed, security and reliability of a static site with the slick user experiance of a single page app (SPA).

There is no database or server-side code code to worry about, so you can focus on the front-end.

VuePress is based on the much-loved Vue.js framework, which makes it easy to customise the theme and features of your site.

## Why Netlify CMS?

Netlify CMS adds content management interface to your site, making it easy to write, edit and publish your content without having to write any code.
