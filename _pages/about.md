# Hi!

I'm Pete, a Front-end Architect at the Royal College of Nursing based in Cardiff, UK.

This is my personal blog for sharing my learning on all things front-end/UX/UI. I'm kicking off with a series on VuePress, which is what this site is built with.

For now this site is just default VuePress blog theme. At some point I'll get around to designing my own VuePress theme and I will share the process with you here so that you can do the same.

If that sounds helpful, please subscribe:
